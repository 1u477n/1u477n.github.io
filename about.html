    <p>
        I thrive at the intersection of technology and drug discovery, bridging computational and wet-lab approaches to accelerate innovation. 
        With 20+ years of experience spanning biotech startups and global pharmaceutical enterprises, I’ve led cross-functional teams to develop and implement cutting-edge solutions in informatics,
        AI/machine learning, IT strategy, and technical product management. My work has consistently focused on advancing drug discovery through computational methods, predictive analytics, 
        and scalable infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        A core strength of mine is the ability to translate complex scientific and technical challenges into actionable solutions. I’ve collaborated with software engineers, ML researchers, 
        computational chemists, and medicinal chemists to build platforms that streamline R&D workflows and drive data-driven decision-making. 
        I’m deeply familiar with the challenges of integrating AI and computational tools into drug discovery, and I’m passionate about creating systems that empower scientists and accelerate innovation.
    </p>
    <p>        
        I’ve successfully led product roadmaps, IT strategy, and infrastructure initiatives to support AI-driven research. Whether it’s building a scalable informatics platform, 
        designing predictive models, or ensuring seamless cross-functional collaboration, I bring a strategic mindset with a hands-on approach to execution. 
        My expertise extends across machine learning, computational chemistry, and cloud computing, and I’m committed to leveraging technology to solve complex scientific problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        At my core, I’m driven by the impact that technology can have on drug discovery and human health. I thrive in dynamic, interdisciplinary environments where I can bridge technical and 
        scientific domains to drive meaningful progress.
