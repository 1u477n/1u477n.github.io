        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I thrive at the intersection of <strong>technology and drug discovery</strong>, bridging computational and
            wet-lab approaches to accelerate innovation.
            With <strong>20+ years of experience</strong> spanning biotech startups and global pharmaceutical
            enterprises, I’ve led cross-functional teams to develop and implement cutting-edge solutions
            in <strong>informatics, AI/machine learning, IT strategy, and technical product management</strong>. My work
            has consistently focused on advancing drug discovery through computational methods,
            predictive analytics, and scalable infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            A core strength of mine is the ability to <strong>translate complex scientific and technical challenges into
                actionable solutions</strong>. I’ve collaborated with
            software engineers, ML researchers, computational chemists, and medicinal chemists to build platforms that
            streamline R&D workflows and drive data-driven decision-making.
            I’m deeply familiar with the challenges of integrating AI and computational tools into drug discovery, and
            I’m passionate about creating systems that empower scientists and accelerate innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve successfully led <strong>product roadmaps, IT strategy, and infrastructure initiatives</strong> to
            support AI-driven research. Whether it’s building a scalable informatics platform,
            designing predictive models, or ensuring seamless cross-functional collaboration, I bring a strategic
            mindset with a hands-on approach to execution.
            My expertise extends across <strong>machine learning, computational chemistry, and cloud computing</strong>,
            and I’m committed to leveraging technology to solve complex scientific problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            At my core, I’m driven by the <strong>impact that technology can have on drug discovery and human
                health</strong>. I thrive in dynamic, interdisciplinary environments where I can bridge technical and
            scientific domains to drive meaningful progress.
        </p>
